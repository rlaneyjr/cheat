  kubectl logs -lapp=nginx --all-containers=true
  
  # Return snapshot of previous terminated ruby container logs from pod web-1
  kubectl logs -p -c ruby web-1
  
  # Begin streaming the logs of the ruby container in pod web-1
  kubectl logs -f -c ruby web-1
  
  # Display only the most recent 20 lines of output in pod nginx
  kubectl logs --tail=20 nginx
  
  # Show all logs from pod nginx written in the last hour
  kubectl logs --since=1h nginx
  
  # Return snapshot logs from first container of a job named hello
