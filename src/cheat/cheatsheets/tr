# Replace ":" with new line
echo $PATH|tr ":" "\n" #equivalent with:

# Remove all occurance of "ab"
echo aabbcc |tr -d "ab"
# ouput: cc

# Complement "aa"
echo aabbccd |tr -c "aa" 1
# output: aa11111 without new line

echo $PATH|tr -cs "[:alpha:]" "\n" 

# Ordered list to unordered list
echo "1. /usr/bin\n2. /bin" |tr -cs " /[:alpha:]\n" "+"

# Create a list of the words in file1, one per line, where a word is taken to be a maximal string of letters.
tr -cs "[:alpha:]" "\n" < file1

# Translate the contents of file1 to upper-case.

# Preferred over the traditional UNIX idiom of ``tr a-z A-Z'', since it works correctly in all locales.

# Strip out non-printable characters from file1.
tr -cd "[:print:]" < file1

# Remove diacritical marks from all accented variants of the letter `e':
