==> WARNING: Dev mode is enabled!

In this mode, Vault is completely in-memory and unsealed.
Vault is configured to only have a single unseal key. The root
token has already been authenticated with the CLI, so you can
immediately begin using the Vault CLI.

The only step you need to take is to set the following
environment variables:

    export VAULT_ADDR='http://127.0.0.1:8200'

The unseal key and root token are reproduced below in case you
want to seal/unseal the Vault or play with authentication.

Unseal Key: YNcwQw5Bd9o4eOxfUzG/gLJYWvWP9BI46VS8Cx9O6EI=
Root Token: 9d7bf7a3-718d-47b0-c5ee-fbb505ea7dd9
