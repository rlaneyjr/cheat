cheat
=====
This is my version of cheat completely stolen from Chris Allen Lane
`cheat` allows you to create and view interactive cheatsheets on the
command-line. It was designed to help remind \*nix system administrators of
options for commands that they use frequently, but not frequently enough to
remember.
