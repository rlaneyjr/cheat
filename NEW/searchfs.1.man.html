*SEARCHFS(1)               BSD General Commands Manual              SEARCHFS(1)*

*NAME*

     *searchfs* -- fast filename search on HFS+ and APFS volumes

*SYNOPSIS*

     *searchfs* [*-dfespixnoh*] [*-v* _mount_*___*_point_] _search_*___*_term_

*DESCRIPTION*

     *searchfs* searches for files by name on HFS+ and APFS volumes. Searching
     takes place at the driver level using the file system catalog via the
     low-level searchfs() function. This means the volume's entire directory
     tree can be scanned much faster than with a standard recursive directory
     search using e.g. find.

     Paths of files and directories with names containing the search term are
     printed to STDOUT, one path per line. Search is case-insensitive by
     default

     The following flags are supported:

     *-v,* *--volume*
              Specify volume to search. Default is the root file system at /.

     *-d,* *--dirs-only*
              Return only matching directories.

     *-f,* *--files-only*
              Return only matching files.

     *-e,* *--exact-match*
              Return only exact filename matches.

     *-s,* *--case-sensitive*
              Case sensitive matching.

     *-p,* *--skip-packages*
              Don't match file system objects that are inside a package. A
              package is defined as a directory whose extension matches one of
              the extensions that are configured into the kernel by Launch
              Services.

     *-i,* *--skip-invisibles*
              Don't match invisible file system objects (that is, objects with
              the Finder attribute "Invisible" set) or any objects within
              invisible directories.

     *-x,* *--skip-inappropriate*
              Don't match any file system objects that are within an "inappro-
              priate" directory.  Apple's current list of inappropriate direc-
              tories contains one item: /System.

     *-n,* *--negate-params*
              List all file system objects that do *not* match the search cri-
              teria.

     *-o,* *--version*
              Print program version and exit.

     *-h,* *--help*
              Print usage and exit.

*EXAMPLES*

     Find directories with name matching 'something' on root volume:

           searchfs -d something

     Find file with the exact name 'file.txt' on volume 'SomeHD':

           searchfs -v /Volumes/SomeHD -e file.txt
