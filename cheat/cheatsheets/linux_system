Troubleshooting General UNIX, Networking

Files, Directories & Disks
Display the Disk Usage of file sizes under each directory in the current directory
       du -k * | sort -nr | more   or   du -h . | sort -nr
Display the files in the directory by file size
       ls -ltr | sort -nr -k 5
Display top ten largest files/directories
       du -hk * | sort -nr | head
How much space is used for users in kilobytes
       quot –af
List the hidden files in current directory
       ls -a1 | grep "^\."
How do you find out drive statistics
       iostat -E
Change to a directory, which is having very long name
       cd CDMA_3X_GEN*
Here original directory name is – “CDMA_3X_GENERATION_DATA”.
Display the all files recursively with path under current directory
       find . -depth –print
Search for strings in all files down the directory tree
       find . -type f -print | xargs egrep -i "expression”
Processes

Display what process is using a specific port

       /usr/local/bin/lsof –i :<port>
Display the processes, which are running under a username
       ps –aef | grep <username>
Display the parent/child tree of a process
       ptree <pid> 		Example: ptree 1267
Show the working directory of a process
       pwdx <pid> 		Example: pwdx 1267
Display the processes current open files
       pfiles <pid> 		Example: pfiles 1267
Display the inter-process communication facility status
       ipcs
Check process utilization of the CPU
       prstat -a
Display the page size of memory
       pagesize -a
Networking
Display Ethernet Address arp table
       arp -a
Display the number of active established connections to localhost
       netstat -a | grep EST
Display the state of interfaces used for TCP/IP traffic'[BR]]

       netstat –i
Check speed and duplex of the network connection
       kstat ce:0 | grep link_
Check link partner speed capabilities of the network connection
       kstat ce:0 | grep lp_cap
Check local speed capabilities of the network connection
       kstat ce:0 | grep cap_
Shells, Etc
Delete blank lines in a file
       cat sample.txt | grep -v ‘^$’ > new_sample.txt
Search for a sample string in particular files
       grep “Debug” *.conf   
Here grep uses the string “Debug” to search in all files with extension “.conf” under current directory.
Set the Display automatically for the current new user
       export DISPLAY=`eval ‘who am i | cut -d"(" -f2 | cut -d")" -f1'`
Here in above command, see single quote, double quote, grave ascent is used. Observe carefully.
